Q4 - Vending Machine
//Instructions:

/*
Given two integers as user inputs that represent the number of drinks to buy and the number of bottles to restock, 
create a VendingMachine object that performs the following operations:

Purchases input number of drinks
Restocks input number of bottles
Reports inventory
The VendingMachine is found in VendingMachine.java. A VendingMachine's initial inventory is 20 drinks.

Ex: If the input is:

5 2
the output is:

Inventory: 17 bottles
*/

//Solution: Note: Code is given - Student writes wherever specified: 

//LabProgram.java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class LabProgram {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
      
      /* Type your code here. */ 
      int amountPurchase = scnr.nextInt();
      int amountRestock = scnr.nextInt();
      
      VendingMachine vendingmachine = new VendingMachine();
      
      vendingmachine.purchase(amountPurchase);
      vendingmachine.restock(amountRestock);
      vendingmachine.report();
   }
}


//VendingMachine.java
// simulates a simple vending machine with operations to purchase drinks and check inventory.
public class VendingMachine {
   
   // number of bottle in stock
   private int bottles;
   
   // initial inventory is 20
   public VendingMachine(){
      bottles = 20;
   }

   public void purchase(int amount){
      bottles = bottles - amount;
   }
  
   public int getInventory(){
      return bottles;
   }

   public void restock(int amount){
      bottles = bottles + amount;
   }
 
   public void report(){
      System.out.println("Inventory: " + bottles + " bottles");
   }
   
}
